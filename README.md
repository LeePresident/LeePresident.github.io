### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is for a simple website of my virtual bus company (StarTone Transport) in a Minecraft server named Project Nazca Server. The website is currently available Chinese and English.

The website is primarily coded in HTML and JavaScript, and the mainframe is created using GenAI.
